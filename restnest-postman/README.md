# restnest-postman - service-published,generated collections

As configured in environments/restnest-postman.postman_globals.base.json (workspace_name/workspace_id), the Postman workspace, which contains all the collections and environments (see e.g. Postman Workspace restnest-postman) auto-generated from domain services, is queried per Postman API and the collections/environments are stored in this folder.

Other configurations, i.e. Postman APIKey (see scripts/postmanSyncPrep.js), as well as services and versions, etc. are also stored in the above global files for use in determining which collections to use for the scenarioSetup.
